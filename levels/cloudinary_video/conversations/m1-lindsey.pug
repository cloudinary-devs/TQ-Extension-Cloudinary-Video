        Oh hey! I'm Lindsey, the Cloudinary ship's office manager! I heard a lot about you! We have been needing a professional to help us 
        with working with videos!
        Have you spoke with Hagit yet to set up your employee badge?
      speech.
        Welcome aboard the #[break(strength="medium")] Cloudinary Ship!

        You can find Hagit to the right, a few steps away from me!

        Follow the white tiles to the right, and eventually you will find a door on the bottom 
        that will lead you to a corridor of all the employee offices.
        Speak with Keren there, who will guide you within the corridor of offices.
