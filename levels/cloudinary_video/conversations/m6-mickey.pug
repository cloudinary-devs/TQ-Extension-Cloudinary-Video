          WOOHOO! I love how Cloudinary lets you set your videos to high quality. 
          I'm curious to see if the audio is also enhanced to high quality as well!

          Oh, I see you need some help with these quality missions. 
          I suggest using the <strong>Help</strong> tab in the objective modules 
          to access our in-depth Cloudinary documentation. 
          That should help you get the job done!

          ... I don't know what you're talking about! All I see are cats on the screen.
          Maybe you're thinking about those dogs in the distance. Speaking of which, I better 
          check up on Branch in the main lobby!
