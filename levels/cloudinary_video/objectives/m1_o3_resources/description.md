<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Navigate</b> to the different resource URLs</li>
  <li>Join the Media Developers <b>Discord</b> Community</li>
</ul>
</div>

Before we can really get started, you'll need to know where to find all of the resources and documentation. 

In the help tab, we've provided links to documentation and resources that you can use to solve the objectives while on deck in the **Cloudinary Ship**.

Two resources we recommend for this mission are:
- [Cloudinary Documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)
- [Cloudinary Academy](https://training.cloudinary.com?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021)

You will refer back to these links from time to time. Be sure to get familiar with them!

## Discord Community
