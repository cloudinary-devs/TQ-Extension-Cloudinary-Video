## Detailed Instructions
The Cloudinary Video Player can be used in any webpage thanks to the power of HTML and Javascript. Learn more about its basic implementations [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021).

To solve this challenge, you should focus on the Javascript implementation to make the `doc-player` video element work. Find the `// ----- Put your JS code below ----- //` comment on line ### and start implementing the Javascript code for the video player there.

If you have trouble running the localhost server after pressing the _▶_ button, please check your firewall settings to make sure the local server can run.
