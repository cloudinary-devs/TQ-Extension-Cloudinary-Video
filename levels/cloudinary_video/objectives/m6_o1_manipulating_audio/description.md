Yay! Thanks for helping us out with this video. Our dog must have turned up the volume and all I hear is the loud music! If we can lower the volume to the dog video, it'll make the viewing experience much more fun. Can you help us out?

## Preparation
We'll be using videos from the **Cloudinary demo account**. You set this up in Mission 5: Video Editing, but in case you forgot, let's double check that you made an auto upload mapping!
1. Go to [Upload Settings](https://cloudinary.com/console/lui/settings/upload?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) in the [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) and create a new **Auto Upload mapping** with these settings:
   - Folder: demo
   - URL Prefix: https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/
2. Confirm that the settings are saved by pressing the **"Save"** button on the bottom of the webpage. This will make all of the Cloudinary demo account files available for transformation in our account through a virtual /demo folder.

## Instructions

1. Get the link to the dog video from your demo folder. It should look something like this:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/video/upload/<version>/demo/dog.mp4
```

2. Now, take that video and lower its volume by 80%. Paste that as the link for answer 1.

3. Take the same video and mute it. Paste that as the link for answer 2.

4. Click _HACK_ to proceed.
