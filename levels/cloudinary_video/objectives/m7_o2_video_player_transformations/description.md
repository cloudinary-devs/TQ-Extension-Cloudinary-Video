Nice work so far! Next, we need to use another **video player** to play our **TwilioQuest Flower video** but with some additional information and transformations. You remember how to do transformations, right? Let's reapply that knowledge in this objective!

## Preparation
Learn more about our Cloudinary video player [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021). If you need additional resources, check out the __Help__ tab above!




1. Open the **code editor** by clicking on the _\</> Show Code Editor_ button on the right.
2. You'll notice a web application's source code in the code box. Fill in the code block that says `// ----- Edit the video properties below ----- //` . Use the example in the link above to help you!
3. Be sure to add the following attributes:
  - The sample code's defined variable names should be left as is.
  - The video should be the TwilioQuest Flower video you've used in previous objectives.
  - The video player should have a title, subtitle, and description.
  - The crop should be set to fill, and the video size should be 300x300 pixels.
4. Set your cloud name under the `// ----- Edit the cloud name below ----- //`
5. Run the server by pressing the _â–¶_ button.
