### Detailed Instructions
_r__ is the general transformation parameter that is used to round corners of the video (and images too, with [even more options](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#r_round_corners)!). Take a look at [Rounding Corners and creating circular videos](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery#rounding_corners_and_creating_circular_videos) to answer the questions.

For the other parameters, like color, refer back to the documentation or the objectives in **Mission 4**!
