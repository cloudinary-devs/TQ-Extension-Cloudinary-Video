Just like the _l_text_ layers that we added in the last objective, we can add images using the root layer _l\_video:_ property and appending the public name of an image from our account. 

For complete information, see [Adding Image Overlays](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery#adding_image_overlays) and pay careful attention to the Important note. Since we are using an image from our TwilioQuest folder we'll need to use the ":" notation like "twilioquest:cloudinary_icon".

This question also requires setting the opacity [_o\__](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#o_opacity) so that the icon blends in with the video a little better.
