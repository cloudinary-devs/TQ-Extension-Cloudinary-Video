Wow, way to go! You're doing great with the management of our **Flower** video. Our partners will be very excited to use it.

We also want to leave our mark on the video. Why don't we put the Cloudinary logo on it? A picture on a video... sounds like a challenge!

> <b>TIP:</b> Experiment with URLs without leaving the game, using the <button onclick='window.CloudinaryBrowser.showUrlExplorer();'>Cloudinary Explorer</button>

## Preparation Steps
1. Upload this **Cloudinary icon file** to your account in your [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021): <br><a download href="<%=getLocalImage('cloudinary_icon.png')%>"><%=getLocalImage('cloudinary_icon.png')%></a>(click to download)
2. Put it in the **TwilioQuest** folder in your Media Library.
3. Rename the uploaded **Cloudinary icon file** to "cloudinary_icon". (strip off any extra unique characters if they have been added to the name.)
