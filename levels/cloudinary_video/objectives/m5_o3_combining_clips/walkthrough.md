### Detailed Instructions

## Auto Upload Mapping
Auto Upload Mapping is discussed in the Objectives tab. See the "Preparation" section over there for the instructions. 

To test that it works, try to open this URL, using your cloud name:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud-name>/video/upload/demo/kitten_fighting.mp4
```

## Splicing

Creating a video from multiple other videos requires some fairly complicated urls so here are some useful tips.

The last part of the url (the target video) will be the first video that plays in the sequence, and then all of the _fl_splice_ sections will play in order of appearance in the url.

Each spliced clip will take the form of:
```/fl_splice,l_video:<public id>/<any transforms of the clip>/fl_layer_apply/
```

_fl_splice_ causes the clip to be spliced in (concatenated), instead of overlayed.

_l_video_ and _/fl_layer_apply/_ are start and end tags, wrapping up any transforms that need to be applied to the clip.

Example:
~~~text
.../video/upload/c_fill,w_300/fl_splice,l_video:cat.mp4/c_fill,w_300/fl_layer_apply/fl_splice,l_video:kitten_fighting.mp4/c_fill,w_300/fl_layer_apply/dog.mp4
~~~
<div>
   <video muted controls width="600">
      <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/c_fill,w_300/fl_splice,l_video:cat.mp4/c_fill,w_300/fl_layer_apply/fl_splice,l_video:kitten_fighting.mp4/c_fill,w_300/fl_layer_apply/dog.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
</div>

Notice the ordering of the videos appearing: the dog, then the cat, then the kitten. Also note that `c_fill` and the sizes are all the same. The ordering of the dog video parameters and the actual video name matters- be careful!
