Great work! You're doing a great job with your asset management here at the **Business Development Department**.

Now that you renamed your video asset to **Flower**, it'll be easier to work with! We want you to understand URL parameters and scaling videos. It'll be easy, promise! This will also make our partners happy when they ask for special flower videos!

********************
## <a name="questions">Instructions</a>

Let's experiment with our URLs by adding parameters.

1. For the first answer: **Original Answer URL**, enter your original flower video URL by copying it from your Cloudinary [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021).

2. For the second answer: **Scaled Down URL**, add `/c_scale,w_0.5/` after the `/upload/` parameter in your URL from the first answer. This will scale your flower video by 50%.

Click _HACK_ to proceed. If you entered the URLs correctly, you will see a side by side comparison of the original and scaled versions!
