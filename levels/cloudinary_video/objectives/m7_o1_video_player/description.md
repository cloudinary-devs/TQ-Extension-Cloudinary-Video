Thanks for your help! We can't wait to deploy our website to show all the Cloudinary videos! We made a **video player** that can play our videos anywhere on any webpage, but we need some help setting it up. Can you help us?

********************

## Preparation
Learn more about our Cloudinary video player [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021). 

We can use the power of the [Video Player Studio](https://studio.cloudinary.com/?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021) to generate our embedded video player.

1. Open the **Video Player Studio** using the link above.
2. Under the Video tab, in the Video Source section, select "My Cloudinary Video".
3. Enter your cloudname and the Public ID of your flower video in the corresponding input boxes.
4. Under the Customization tab, in the Player Size section, select "Fixed".
5. Set the width of the video to 600.
6. On the bottom of the web browser, select the "Embed" tab.
7. Select the _Copy to clipboard_ button.
1. In TwilioQuest, open the **code editor** by clicking on the _\</> Show Code Editor_ button on the right.
2. You'll notice a web application's source code in the code box. Fill in the code block that says `<!-- Place your iframe below this line -->` . 
4. Run the server by pressing the _â–¶_ button.
5. If the code looks correct, then click _HACK_ to proceed.
