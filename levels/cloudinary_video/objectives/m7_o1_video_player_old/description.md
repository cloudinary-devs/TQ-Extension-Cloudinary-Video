Thanks for your help! We can't wait to deploy our website to show all the Cloudinary videos! We made a **video player** that can play our videos anywhere on any webpage, but we need some help setting it up. Can you help us?

********************

## Preparation
Learn more about our Cloudinary video player [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021). It's simple to add to our website! There's a sample code incuded on that webpage. Why don't you give it a shot, using that template in the code editor?

1. Open the **code editor** by clicking on the _\</> Show Code Editor_ button on the right.
2. You'll notice a web application's source code in the code box. Fill in the code block that says `// ----- Put your JS code below ----- //` . Use the example in the link above to help you!
3. Be sure to add the following attributes:
- The sample code's defined variable names should be left as is.
- The video player's width needs to be 600 pixels wide.
- The video should be the Flower video from your Media Library.
- One transformation needs to be applied to your video via the demoplayer's source function parameters!
4. Run the server by pressing the _â–¶_ button.
5. If the code looks correct, then click _HACK_ to proceed.
