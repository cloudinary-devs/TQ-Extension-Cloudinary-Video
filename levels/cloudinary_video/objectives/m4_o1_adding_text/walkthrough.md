### Detailed Instructions
You'll need to refer back to this help section for future missions, but you'll find everything you need for this mission below!

The feature we're look for is called [Text Overlays](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_manipulation_and_delivery?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#adding_text_overlays) and uses over**L**ay parameters, specifically *l_text:*

```
.../video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video/
```
This will add a "Sample Video" watermark in Arial font, sized 80 pixels large, to our dog video and will last the full duration of the video.
<div>
   <video muted controls width="600">
      <source src="https://demo-res.cloudinary.com/video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video/dog.webm" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
</div>

Cloudinary supports all [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and even [your own custom/purchased fonts](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/layers?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#custom_fonts). 

You can also use CSS-like styles: 

`.../video/upload/l_text:verdana_75_bold_underline_letter_spacing_14:Flowers`

## Duration

We can provide start *so_* and end *eo_* timing parameters measuring in seconds from the start of the video:
```
.../video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video,so_2.0,eo_5.0/
```

<div>
   <video muted controls width="600">
      <source src="https://demo-res.cloudinary.com/video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video,so_2.0,eo_5.0/dog.webm" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
</div>

Text that lasts a video's full duration does not need the *so_* and *eo_* timing parameters.

## Position

We can also position it using the gravity *g_* parameter and *x_* and *y_* to offset it from the edge(s) defined by the gravity. So if we wanted to move the watermark to 20 pixels from the very bottom of the screen, we would add:
```
g_south,y_20
```
for a long series of parameters like:
~~~text
.../video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video,so_2.0,eo_5.0,g_south,y_20/
~~~
<div>
   <video muted controls width="600">
      <source src="https://demo-res.cloudinary.com/video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video,so_2.0,eo_5.0,g_south,y_20/dog.webm" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
</div>

Here is a chart of all gravity directions you can use:

||||
|--|--|--|
|Top Right<br>`g_north_east`|Top<br>`g_north`|Top Right<br>`g_north_west`|
|Left<br>`g_west`|Middle<br>`g_center`|Right<br>`g_east`|
|Bottom Left<br>`g_south_west`|Bottom<br>`g_south`|Bottom Right<br>`g_south_east`|


Example:
```
.../video/upload/l_text:arial_80:Sample%20Video,so_2.0,eo_5.0,g_south,y_20,co_e3000088/
```

Can you guess how to put the text for your **Flower** video on the bottom right?
