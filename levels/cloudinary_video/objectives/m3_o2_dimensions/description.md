Great job on improving the quality of the **Flower** video! 

One more thing: we do need to resize and crop the video for our big press release! It is important we have this perfectly optimized. Are you up for the task?

> <b>TIP:</b> Experiment with URLs without leaving the game, using the <button onclick='window.CloudinaryBrowser.showUrlExplorer();'>Cloudinary Explorer</button>

## Specific Instructions 
Buckle up!  We're going to cover a bunch of parameters all at once. Fortunately, they are all related to changing the size and shape of a video.

We can tell Cloudinary to **resize** and **crop** videos in order to match specific needs. You can dynamically create multiple resized, cropped and manipulated videos on-the-fly and deliver them via dynamic URLs.
