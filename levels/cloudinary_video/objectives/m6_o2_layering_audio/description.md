Nice work with the dog video! Now, we want to take that video and apply it to a kitten video as well. This should be as easy as applying an overlay to the kitten video. Can you help us with that?

## Preparation
1. Use the same method that you got the `dog.mp4` video to get the fighting kittens video:

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud_name>/video/upload/<version>/demo/kitten_fighting.mp4
```
2. Now, download [this dog audio file](https://assets.mixkit.co/sfx/download/mixkit-horde-of-barking-dogs-60.wav) to your computer.

3. After downloading the file, upload it to the **TwilioQuest** folder in your [Media Library](https://cloudinary.com/console/media_library?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021). 

4. Rename the uploaded file to `dog.wav`.

5. Now, apply the `/TwilioQuest/dog.wav` audio file as a video layer on top of the fighting kitten video.

6. Put your resulting responses in the answer box on the right, and click _HACK_ to proceed.
