- [Audio Overlays](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_layers?utm_source=twilio&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cloudinary-twilioquest-2021#audio_overlays) 

## Detailed Instructions
Add an additional audio track over the existing video using the video overlay parameter (`l_video` in URLs) and the public ID of the audio file from your account.

By following the link above, you can learn more about audio overlays and why they may be useful in video transformations using Cloudinary!

Example: Music on hourglass

~~~text
.../video/upload/l_video:electronic/fl_layer_apply/hourglass_timer.mp4
~~~
<div>
   <video muted controls width="600">
      <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/l_video:electronic/fl_layer_apply/hourglass_timer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
</div>

Note that "electronic" is an .mp3 audio file.

Now, what would you do if you need to apply multiple layers of audio?
